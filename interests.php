            It All Started With the Weather...

                On September 11, 2009, I awoke to buckets of rain pouring from the sky with wind whipping through my yard. My dad and I were appalled that the National Weather Service failed to warn the public about this colossal rainstorm we had been tracking for days. We took our chances and ventured out before sunrise to the Point in Longport, New Jersey - the spot where the ocean meets the bay. The waves crashed over the rocks onto the street, and water rushed up to the front porches of million-dollar homes, nearly knocking us off our feet. This unnamed, unclassified tropical storm had peak gusts of 61 mph at Atlantic City International Airport, and I was lucky enough to witness it first-hand, all in time to make it to school, dripping wet. Following the weather since I was four years old, I grew up with an analytical mindset.

                Following my wide array of interests, I came to Cornell as an Atmospheric Sciences major with a plan to explore Business and Engineering. The first few semesters made it clear that while weather would always be an interest of mine, I was looking to pursue a different type of career. Looking to challenge myself, I signed up for Engineering math and programming courses to test the waters. My Object-Oriented Programming class really intrigued me as I had to create complex programs, such as a map-traversing algorithm, focusing the technical majors in my line of sight.

               With strong interests in business, programming, and human-computer interaction, I transferred to the College of Engineering to major in ISST. While I could have stayed in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) to major in Information Science, the ISST program, through Engineering, delves deeper into Computer Science and Operations Research than its CALS alternative. I wanted to challenge myself with Engineering math and science courses to gain a technical edge in future positions. As a Junior, I am narrowing my interests to graduate with strong technical, communicative, and entrepreneurial skills.

                    Growing up near the beach, I have enjoyed many summer afternoons under the warm Jersey sun. I have also tacked on 6 millimeters of wetsuit to dive into the 35-degree ocean after a blizzard to squeeze in an hour of surfing. I finally jumped onto a surfboard for the first time as an 11-year-old beach bum after admiring the angry ocean during a tropical storm. What started out as a curiosity has led to a hobby, which has developed into a lifestyle. In high school, I would set my alarm for 4 a.m. to score a solid surf session before school started at 8 a.m. Living far away from any ocean for the majority of the year now, I have to settle for lackluster summer surf with the hopes of catching a lucky break while I am home.

                  Always looking for new things to try, I picked up golfing this past year. I was visiting my grandparents in Florida and decided to hit the driving range. With very little experience, sans some professional-grade mini-golf, I was surprised at how far I could drive the ball. When the weather became nice enough back home, I signed up for a few lessons and was on my way. Now, I tackle the recreational golf course at Cornell, trying to play at least once a week while discovering what a frustrating and rewarding game it can be. With my long irons locked down and my driver coming along nicely, I'm looking to improve my not-so-great short game to limit those dreaded three-putts.
