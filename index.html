I was brought on to interface with the design teams and clients closest to the issue.<p>After analyzing client usage data, I found that the average client only used 5% of available icons in the system, so I proposed building an identification and prioritization tool to narrow issue scope. I quickly designed and launched the tool with support engineers from our first client upgrades before rolling it out across all upgrading customers. The tool worked very well for OpTime clients, so I expanded the scope across all clinical applications and created a process for all support engineers to follow.<p>In the end, we collectively saved over 10,000 client hours during their busy upgrade season.</div></div><div class="row chunk"><div class="columns work-prj left medium-6 large-5"><img alt="KLAS award"src=images/works/klas_optime.svg></div><div class="columns medium-6 large-7"><h4>Led Visual Redesign of Epic OpTime</h4><p>There was a company-wide initiative to modernize the look and feel of Epic's software in the 2016 release.
