            Hi, I'm Noah. I like to design and build things. My latest project revolves around developing and marketing a flight-action game called DASH, which you can learn more about below.

                    <a href='http://dash-game.com'>DASH</a> is a fast-paced action-platformer where your sole movement mechanic is an aerial dash attack. Rated “Best in Show” by IndieHangover.com at the 2014 Boston Festival of Indie Games, DASH won the 'Most Polished Game' and 'Audience Favorite' awards at Cornell's annual Game Design Initiative Showcase and is the <a href="http://gdiac.cs.cornell.edu/gallery/index.php">highest-rated game</a> ever developed through the game design program. Built with LibGDX for Desktop, Android, and iOS, DASH is set for release on iOS and Android this summer (2015).

                <p>
                    As project lead, I am involved in all aspects of the game; from code to level design and polish to marketing, I make sure everything runs smoothly.

                    One of the player's abilities is to slow down the game rate by entering slow-mo, which is activated on mobile by tap-and-holding anywhere on the screen and on Desktop by holding down the space-bar. This is a critical skill that comes in handy early on as levels quickly approach Super-Meat-Boy style difficulty. Since the vast majority of gamers simply refuse to read any kind of in-game text prompt, I had to find a way to elegantly teach players this ability. Since this is still a tutorial level, the player is still getting used to gameplay mechanics and is probably struggling to complete simple challenges. While definitely do-able by a skilled player, a novice will note the sudden spike in difficulty compared to previous levels and will probably have a tough time completing this level without slow-mo. If they ignored the prompt the first few tries, they will soon realize, "Hey, maybe I should read this thing that keeps popping up every time I die," and will easily complete the level.

                    To design levels, we built a custom built level editor with <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3</a> to make any level imaginable. Each level designer has their own technique, but I usually follow the same creative process:
                    <ol start="0">
                        <li>Pray for creative juices to start flowing</li>
                    </ol>
                    <!-- <hr> -->
                    <ol>
                        <li>Jot down ideas on types of challenges to be included, which emotions I'm trying to play off the player (eg. fast-paced = highly focused, tense, alert), and which secondary objectives may fit well with the level</li>
                        <li>Sketch out core challenge on pen and paper</li>
                        <li>Translate core challene into editor</li>
                        <li>Playtest level</li>
                        <li>Make necessary adjustments, or possibly scrap level entirely and return to step 2</li>
                        <li>Add rest of level</li>
                        <li>Send level through peer review process</li>
                        <li>Make final adjustments before testing and polish obstacles, enemy placement, and other level elements</li>
                        <li>Playtest on friends and Beta testers</li>
                        <li>Finalize level</li>

                    Each level has an artifact (the token with blue flames) strategically placed in a hard to reach area that can help you unlock new worlds quicker. While not required to complete a level, they add an extra layer of difficulty to each level for the more skilled players, who get rewarded with an extra game mode once they 'catch em all'. I made the following level look deceivingly easy, but it takes some strategy to figure out. First, some background: your sole movement mechanic is dashing at targetables (enemies, lanterns, artifacts) by tapping/clicking on them. You collect artifacts by simply passing through them, but you drop them in place if you are hit by an enemy. The shielded enemies block the entrance from the right side and will 'punch' you with their shields if you get too close. Also, the blue birds on the top left charge up a projectile fireball that they shoot at you. Now, the player isn't given the inside scoop like I just gave you, but see if you can figure out what to do.

                    I re-designed a local mental illness support group's website for the final project of <a href="http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=18&coid=239860">INFO 2300 - Intermediate Web Design</a> along with Nitin Rajinikanth, Vincent Bello, and Angel Martinez. The original site was very condensed and text-heavy, with little design thought and a confusing navigation system. As project leader, I was in charge of gathering the client's needs and requirements, translating these into wireframes and low-fidelity sketches, designing the <a href="#" data-reveal-id="erModal">database schema</a>, and implementing much of the backend.

                    Unfortunately, our client had trouble setting up the database on their end and decided to outsource their site redesign, which can be seen at <a href="http://www.namifingerlakes.org/" target="blank">www.namifingerlakes.org</a>. I have uploaded a static version of <a href="nami_static/index.html" target="blank">our implementation</a> as well as a <a href="#" data-reveal-id="namiWriteupModal">full writeup</a> detailing our thought process and design choices.

                    <a href="http://invis.io/DH1NU21KF" target="blank">FreshAir</a> is an allergy detection and alert system that maps common airborne allergens via a crowdsourced network of sensors. I designed the app interface along with Emily Lutz and Maddy Butzbach as part of <a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA14/class/INFO/3450">INFO 3450 - Human Computer Interaction</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our task was to solve a problem facing the world today by designing a novel system utilizing any technology that would be feasible within the next 10 years. After an interesting brainstorming session where we tossed around over 100 ideas (two words: bubble boy), we chose to tackle seasonal allergies through a detection and alert system composed of a wearable sensor and a mobile app. The sensors would be carried at all times to gather continuous air quality data throughout the day, which would be aggregated and transformed into an interactive map with overlays depicting the locations of relevant allergens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We broke up potential users into four personas:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Mild allergy sufferer</li>
                        <li>Severe allergy sufferer</li>
                        <li>Asthma-sufferer from polluted area</li>
                        <li>Non-allergy sufferer</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We asked them all sorts of questions such as <i>What is your worst experience/memory related to allergies?</i> and <i>What measures do you take to prevent and/or stop allergy attacks from happening?</i> to find out when, where, and how often they are affected by allergies/pollution as well as their degree of adversion to discover current motivations and techniques for handling them. We thought it would be interesting to interview a non-allergy sufferer as well to see if they had any additional insight or could think of other potential uses for this kind of system. After interviewing people fitting these personas, we constructed a Work Affinity Activity Diagram to group common themes from different responders. (Click the picture below for a higher fidelity PDF)

                    Through persona interviews, we found that people would not be willing to carry around a clunky sensor, especially since it had to be exposed at all times. We interviewed a wearable technology expert at Cornell University who said that although these types of sensors are not quite small enough today, the technology should evolve to the point where they can be accessorized into earrings, necklaces, and bracelets. This way, people could make a fashion statement by equipping everyday accessories with stylish, high-tech sensors.

                    From here, I storyboarded '<a href="#" data-reveal-id="storyboardModal">A day in the life of John</a>' (our allergy sufferer), and we each created low-fidelity mockups of proposed concept designs.

                <p>
                    We thought it would be cool to add in a <a href="http://youtu.be/sP0WNX1AxVs">glasses component</a> that would highlight affected areas through a colored overlay projected directly through the lens. It would take in the same data used for the map to cover your entire field of vision so that as you look around, you can see exactly where the affected areas are. This technology would ideally integrate directly with any pair of glasses you owned, and the overlay feature could be turned on/off to the user's liking. After performing concept validation on our test personas, the glasses and the map proved popular. They liked how the glasses provided immediate information about their surroundings, which complemented the ability to plan routes around affected areas in advance by using the map.

                    I was selected to participate in Cornell's <a href="http://cornell.3daystartup.org/">3 Day Startup</a> this past fall along with 40 other driven, entrepreneurial students. Out of over 40 ideas pitched, mine was selected through a blind vote as one of five startups to be pursued over the weekend. I led my team through the stages of the <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles">Lean Startup Method</a> by identifying the target market, performing customer validation, fine-tuning the business model, and developing on an MVP.

                    After 52 grueling hours, I pitched the business to a panel of 6 Venture Capitalists, entrepreneurs, and mentors in front of an audience of over 150. All in all, it was a thrilling experience where I got a glance into the fast-paced startup world by picking the brains of Cornell's best and brightest and a group of awesome mentors who are out in the field.

                    As part of <a href="http://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/info3300/">INFO 3300 - Data Driven Web Applications</a>, I created a visualization of passenger survival rate on the Titanic based on demographic data incuding age, social class, price of ticket, and gender. Passengers are broken up into 3 tiers based on their social class, with upper class on the top, descending to lower class on the bottom. Within each class, the points are plotted based on their ticket fare. You can view the full source code on <a href="https://github.com/GrossestMan/Titanic">Github</a>.

                    Last summer, I was an ITLP Intern (Information Technology Leadership Program) with GE Capital at their headquarters in Norwalk, CT. I built an IT Audit Tracker that replaced a static weekly report which was prone to human error and costly to assemble. The frontend was built on Twitter Bootstrap for interactive filtering and categorizing capabilities and the backend was built on Django. After presenting to IT Risk Executives, the CIO of GE Capital picked up the Audit Tracker for use at his weekly staff meetings.

                    I was appointed chair of the Tech committee and organized a hackathon where 80% of the interns participated. Since we were spread out across 3 different areas (Connecticut, New Orleans, and Chicago), it was a great way to come together as a class and hack together some cool projects. My group built an interactive heat map highlighting urgent IT Issues across all global locations using <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/geochart">Geocharts</a>.

<!-- 
        <p>
        My name is Noah Grossman and I'm a senior studying Information Science, Systems, and Technology with a minor in Business. I grew up at the Jersey Shore, just outside of Atlantic City, so I've been spoiled by the best beaches the East Coast has to offer. I originally came to Cornell as an Atmospheric Sciences major with my eyes set on becoming a Meteorologist, but soon realized a career in weather forecasting wasn't for me. I quickly switched to a Computer Science and eventually ended up in Info Sci focusing in Information Systems and Human Computer Interaction.

I've got a wide range of interests, with some of my passions including game design, iOS development, and entrepreneurship. Over the past year, I've been developing a game called DASH with a group of 5 other Cornell students. The game is currently in Beta testing (come find me if you want to snag a version), and we plan on releasing on both iOS and Android this summer. I'm also working with some other Cornell students on a startup that focuses on bringing alternative sources of revenue to independent game developers.

When I'm not busy working, you can find me checking the surf camera for my home break in Margate, NJ. This past winter break, I went down to a small group of islands in Panama called Bocas Del Toro (Google it, seriously...) and spent 6 days surfing world class waves in an uncrowded lineup. I still find myself imagining I'm down there eating $8 filet on the dock of some restaurant in the middle of paradise.
</p>
<p>I like to design and build things. Right now, my main project revolves around building and marketing a tablet-based action game, DASH, which you can learn more about below.</p> -->
