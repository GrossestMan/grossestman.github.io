                        Dash has a steep learning curve. Exploration is a common theme throughout the game, so we teach the game’s unique dashing mechanics and challenges through trial and error in lieu of obstrusive text-based tutorials.

                      <p>
                        There was a critical visual issue in the 2017 release discovered a few weeks before the first client upgrade. Each client was uniquely affected by a change to the system's icons and we needed a quick solution. I was brought on to interface with the design teams and clients closest to the issue.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        After analyzing client usage data, I found that the average client only used 5% of available icons in the system, so I proposed building an identification and prioritization tool to narrow issue scope. I quickly designed and launched the tool with support engineers from our first client upgrades before rolling it out across all upgrading customers. The tool worked very well for OpTime, so I expanded the scope across all clinical applications and created a process for all support engineers to follow.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In the end, we collectively saved over 10,000 client hours during their busy upgrade season.

                        There was a company-wide initiative to redesign the look and feel of Epic's software in the 2016 release. Major components of each application were redesigned, but custom application code created unique visual issues for each product. I led the OpTime project to discover, prioritize, and fix visual issues affecting the product.

                      <p>
                        I recruited a QA team to discover product layout, formatting, and style issues across the product, which I actively triaged and delegated based on impact and development effort. Many issues affected multiple products, so I had to delegate to and work with designers, engineers, and product leads across the company. In the end, my teams discovered and fixed hundreds of visual issues that affected the core product for the 2016 release.

                        I traveled onsite to 15 customer Go-Lives to help users learn how to use the system. As Epic floor support, I joined surgeons and nurses during live cases in the OR to train them on their new workflows and to triage incoming issues with the Epic command center. By working directly with end users, I was able to better empathize with and advocate for their position during design and support discussions.

                    Revibe was a project built over the course of a 10-week pre-accelerator in Tel Aviv, Israel. From over 2,000 applicants, I was accepted as one of 20 to build startup projects with Israeli peers under the guidance of Israeli Venture Capitalists and business leaders.

                    Revibe was a workplace analytics platform that improved employee retention by diagnosing employee engagement issues.

                      <h4>Team Formation</h4>
                      <p>
                        The first two weeks were some of the most formative. We completed a number of team-building competitions in rotating groups to find compatible cofounders. The challenges tested our skills from sales: “You have 3 hours to turn 50 shekel (~15 USD) into as much money as possible,” to product sense: “Create an IOT company and pitch it to a panel of VCs who will be coming by this afternoon.” The intense pressure quickly narrowed our focus towards team members with similar interests and different skillsets.

                      <p>
                        By the end of week 2, I had recruited a team with deep experience in sales, product, and engineering.

                      <p>
                        Having all worked for large companies, my team was interested in understanding the relationship people have with work. We found it interesting that the majority of HR startups are so heavily focused on recruiting the best talent, but there are very few aimed at actually retaining the very employees companies work so hard to recruit. According to Harvard Business Review, employee turnover costs American companies over $30 billion every year, so we set out understand why this was such a big problem.

                      <h4>Validation</h4>
                      <p>
                        I interviewed dozens of managers and HR professionals in Israel and America and learned that they were often caught by surprise when an employee would quit. Losing good talent can disrupt an entire team, and managers were willing to pay to know which employees were at risk of leaving and why. Because of market size, favorable privacy laws, and feedback from customer interviews, we narrowed our early users to be managers at large (5,000+) American companies.

                      <p>
                        Through several rounds of prototyping, I created an interactive prototype that identified employee engagement issues. Using a blend of network communication analysis and feedback pulse surveys, Revibe would capture both the quantitative and the qualitative side of engagement to uncover deep organizational insights. Managers and HR leaders could use Revibe to answer crucial questions about a workforce:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Why are employees leaving at the 2-year mark?</li>
                        <li>Which teams are the most productive, and why?</li>
                        <li>Which employees should we tap for leadership positions?</li>
                        <li>Which employees do people turn to for the answers (i.e experts)?</li>
                      </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="blurb">
                  By the end of the program, we had a working prototype and a number of potential clients that were interested in our product. We decided to pursue other projects post-program, but gained direct experience creating, marketing, and launching an enterprise product.

After developing and presenting the tool to the executive team, the CIO integrated the Audit Tracker into his weekly staff meetings. I developed the tool using HTML/CSS/Javascript and Django.

I saw an opportunity to boost engagement through competitive cash tournaments and was accepted into <a href="http://cornell.3daystartup.org/">3 Day Startup at Cornell</a>, where my idea was voted as one of five projects to be developed during the event.

                <p class="blurb">
                  Seasonal allergies affect over 40 million Americans every year. My project team wanted to create something that helped people cope with indoor and outdoor allergies, so we designed an allergy identification and alert system called FreshAir. I designed the app interface along with Emily Lutz and Maddy Butzbach as part of INFO 3450 - Human Computer Interaction.

                      <h4>How It Works</h4>
                      <p>
                        The system works via a crowdsourced network of wearable and deployed sensors that continuously monitor air quality. Through persona interviews, we found that people often do not know what they are allergic to, and therefore what to avoid. By documenting allergic reactions in the FreshAir app, the system can identify what you are allergic to so you are better prepared both in the household and outdoors.
