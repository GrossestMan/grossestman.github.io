<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="graphics/favicon.ico">
<META NAME="description" CONTENT="NAMI-Finger Lakes is the Ithaca, NY chapter of NAMI. We provide support and mental health information for families and friends of people diagnosed with major mental illnesses.  We seek to educate families and the public about mental illness and advocate for the families and their ill relatives.  As part of our programs, we provide one-on-one counseling; support groups; a free twelve-week Family-to-Family education course for families that helps family members understand and support their ill relatives while maintaining their own well-being.   Illness discussed by this course include major depression, Manic Depression (also known as bipolar disorder), schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, borderline personality disorder, panic disorder, OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), and Dual-Diagnosis (Co-occurring Brain and Addictive Disorders). Our members are also very familiar with Ithaca's excellent social services for people recovering from mental illness. Our office is within walking distance of Cornell University and Ithaca High School, and is across town from Ithaca College.  We are happy to help anyone who contacts us for help - this includes Tompkins County residents; residents of surrounding communities as Corning, Cortland, Binghamton, and Syracuse; and the parents of students attending Ithaca universities. Families from other parts of the US are welcome to contact us - we will do our best to help you.">
