            Hi, I'm Noah. I like to design and build things. Right now, my main project revolves around developing and marketing a flight-action game called DASH, which you can learn more about below.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll be graduating from Cornell University's <a href='http://infosci.cornell.edu/academics'>Information Science</a> department (ISST) through Engineering this coming May and am looking to take my talents to a company where I can make a real impact.

                    <a href='http://dash-game.com'>DASH</a> is a fast-paced action-platformer where your sole movement mechanic is an aerial dash attack. Rated “Best in Show” by IndieHangover.com at the 2014 Boston Festival of Indie Games, DASH won the 'Most Polished Game' and 'Audience Favorite' awards at Cornell's annual Game Design Initiative Showcase and is the highest-rated game ever developed through the game design program. Built with LibGDX for Desktop, Android, and iOS, we are set for release on iOS and Android this summer (2015).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As project lead, I am involved in all aspects of the game; from code to level design and polish to marketing, I make sure everything runs smoothly.

                <p>
                    One of the player's abilities is to slow down the game rate by entering slow-mo, which is activated on mobile by tap-and-holding anywhere on the screen and on Desktop by holding down the space-bar. This is a critical skill that comes in handy early on as levels quickly approach Super-Meat-Boy style difficulty. Since the vast majority of gamers simply refuse to read any kind of in-game text prompt, I had to find a way to elegantly teach players this ability. Since this is still a tutorial level, the player is still getting used to gameplay mechanics and is probably struggling to complete simple challenges. While definitely do-able by a skilled player, a novice will note the sudden spike in difficulty compared to previous levels and will probably have a tough time completing this level without slow-mo. If they ignored the prompt the first few tries, they will soon realize, 'Hey, maybe I should read this thing that keeps popping up every time I restart,' and will easily complete the level.

        My name is Noah Grossman and I'm a senior studying Information Science, Systems, and Technology with a minor in Business. I grew up at the Jersey Shore, just outside of Atlantic City, so I've been spoiled by the best beaches the East Coast has to offer. I originally came to Cornell as an Atmospheric Sciences major with my eyes set on becoming a Meteorologist, but soon realized a career in weather forecasting wasn't for me. I quickly switched to a Computer Science and eventually ended up in Info Sci focusing in Information Systems and Human Computer Interaction.

I've got a wide range of interests, with some of my passions including game design, iOS development, and entrepreneurship. Over the past year, I've been developing a game called DASH with a group of 5 other Cornell students. The game is currently in Beta testing (come find me if you want to snag a version), and we plan on releasing on both iOS and Android this summer. I'm also working with some other Cornell students on a startup that focuses on bringing alternative sources of revenue to independent game developers.

When I'm not busy working, you can find me checking the surf camera for my home break in Margate, NJ. This past winter break, I went down to a small group of islands in Panama called Bocas Del Toro (Google it, seriously...) and spent 6 days surfing world class waves in an uncrowded lineup. I still find myself imagining I'm down there eating $8 filet on the dock of some restaurant in the middle of paradise.
