            Hi, I'm Noah. I like to design and build things. Right now, my main project revolves around developing and marketing a flight-action game called DASH, which you can learn more about below.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll be graduating from Cornell University's <a href='http://infosci.cornell.edu/academics'>Information Science</a> department (ISST) through Engineering this coming May and am looking to take my talents to a company where I can make a real impact.

                    <a href='http://dash-game.com'>DASH</a> is a fast-paced action-platformer where your sole movement mechanic is an aerial dash attack. Rated “Best in Show” by IndieHangover.com at the 2014 Boston Festival of Indie Games, DASH won the 'Most Polished Game' and 'Audience Favorite' awards at Cornell's annual Game Design Initiative Showcase and is the highest-rated game ever developed through the game design program. Built with LibGDX for Desktop, Android, and iOS, DASH are set for release on iOS and Android this summer (2015).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As project lead, I am involved in all aspects of the game; from code to level design and polish to marketing, I make sure everything runs smoothly.

                <p>
                    One of the player's abilities is to slow down the game rate by entering slow-mo, which is activated on mobile by tap-and-holding anywhere on the screen and on Desktop by holding down the space-bar. This is a critical skill that comes in handy early on as levels quickly approach Super-Meat-Boy style difficulty. Since the vast majority of gamers simply refuse to read any kind of in-game text prompt, I had to find a way to elegantly teach players this ability. Since this is still a tutorial level, the player is still getting used to gameplay mechanics and is probably struggling to complete simple challenges. While definitely do-able by a skilled player, a novice will note the sudden spike in difficulty compared to previous levels and will probably have a tough time completing this level without slow-mo. If they ignored the prompt the first few tries, they will soon realize, 'Hey, maybe I should read this thing that keeps popping up every time I restart,' and will easily complete the level.

                    <a href="http://invis.io/DH1NU21KF" target="blank">FreshAir</a> is an allergy detection and alert system that maps common airborne allergens via a crowdsourced network of sensors. I designed the app interface along with Emily Lutz and Maddy Butzbach as part of <a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA14/class/INFO/3450">INFO 3450 - Human Computer Interaction</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our task was to solve a problem facing the world today by designing a novel system utilizing any technology that would be feasible within the next 10 years. After an interesting brainstorming session where we tossed around over 100 ideas (two words: bubble boy), we chose to tackle seasonal allergies through a detection and alert system composed of a wearable sensor and a mobile app. The sensors would be carried at all times to gather continuous air quality data throughout the day, which would be aggregated and transformed into an interactive map with overlays depicting the locations of relevant allergens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We broke up potential users into four personas:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Mild allergy sufferer</li>
                        <li>Severe allergy sufferer</li>
                        <li>Asthma-sufferer from polluted area</li>
                        <li>Non-allergy sufferer</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We asked them all sorts of questions such as <i>What is your worst experience/memory related to allergies?</i> and <i>What measures do you take to prevent and/or stop allergy attacks from happening?</i> to find out when, where, and how often they are affected by allergies/pollution as well as their degree of adversion to discover current motivations and techniques for handling them. We thought it would be interesting to interview a non-allergy sufferer as well to see if they had any additional insight or could think of other potential uses for this kind of system. After interviewing people fitting these personas, we constructed a Work Affinity Activity Diagram to group common themes from different responders. (Click the picture below for a higher fidelity PDF)

                <p>
                    Through persona interviews, we found that people would not be willing to carry around a clunky sensor, especially since it had to be exposed at all times. We interviewed a wearable technology expert at Cornell University who said that although these types of sensors are not quite small enough today, the technology should evolve to the point where they can be accessorized into earrings, necklaces, and bracelets. This way, people could make a fashion statement by equipping everyday accessories with stylish, high-tech sensors.

The original site was very condensed and text-heavy, with little design thought and a confusing navigation system. As project leader, I was in charge of gathering the client's needs and requirements, translating these into wireframes and low-fidelity sketches, designing the <a href="#" data-reveal-id="erModal">database schema</a>, and implementing much of the backend.

<!-- 
        <p>
        My name is Noah Grossman and I'm a senior studying Information Science, Systems, and Technology with a minor in Business. I grew up at the Jersey Shore, just outside of Atlantic City, so I've been spoiled by the best beaches the East Coast has to offer. I originally came to Cornell as an Atmospheric Sciences major with my eyes set on becoming a Meteorologist, but soon realized a career in weather forecasting wasn't for me. I quickly switched to a Computer Science and eventually ended up in Info Sci focusing in Information Systems and Human Computer Interaction.

I've got a wide range of interests, with some of my passions including game design, iOS development, and entrepreneurship. Over the past year, I've been developing a game called DASH with a group of 5 other Cornell students. The game is currently in Beta testing (come find me if you want to snag a version), and we plan on releasing on both iOS and Android this summer. I'm also working with some other Cornell students on a startup that focuses on bringing alternative sources of revenue to independent game developers.

When I'm not busy working, you can find me checking the surf camera for my home break in Margate, NJ. This past winter break, I went down to a small group of islands in Panama called Bocas Del Toro (Google it, seriously...) and spent 6 days surfing world class waves in an uncrowded lineup. I still find myself imagining I'm down there eating $8 filet on the dock of some restaurant in the middle of paradise.
</p>
<p>I like to design and build things. Right now, my main project revolves around building and marketing a tablet-based action game, DASH, which you can learn more about below.</p> -->
